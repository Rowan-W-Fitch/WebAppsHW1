        Huntington Beach is a coastal city in Orange County, CA. Incorporated in 1909, Huntington Beach is located 35 miles south of Downtown Los Angeles. Huntington Beach is bordered by
        Seal Beach to the north, Newport Beach to the south, and Westminster to the east. Santa Catalina Island is also directly west, and can be seen clearly from the shore. Huntington Beach
        was named after Henry Huntington, the railroad magnate of Southern California.

        Huntington Beach is known as "Surf City, USA" because it has some of the most consistent waves year round. During the spring and summer months, Huntington Beach is constantly
        hammered by swells from the South Pacific, which produces fun waves for surfers. During the late fall and winter months, Huntington Beach gets hit by westerly
        swells coming form the North Pacific, which again creates fun waves. Huntington Beach also hosts the US Open of Surfing every August, an internationally renowned surfing competition
        that awards the winner $100,000.
